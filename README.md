# Windows-Terminal-Context-Menu
Regedit file that adds "Open in Terminal" into context menu

Before we continue please place the `wt.ico` into Windows Terminal directory

Don't know where is? No problem! in CMD just type `where wt` and it will print the directory

What are the differences between the reg files?

Well as the name says
- `wt-all-users` Adds the button on the context menu for **all users** that are in your computer
- `wt-single-user` Adds the button on the context menu only for the **current user** in your computer
